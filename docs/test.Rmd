##Introduction
For this assignment, I am looking at incarceration statistics in the US during the past couple decades. I used a dataset from the Vera institute that contains lots of statistics on total populations, by state and county and their breakdowns by race and sex. It also contains information about the people incarcerated, like their race, whether they are a juvenile and why they are in jail. Some of the specific values that I explored are the states that have the largest proportions of their populations in jails as well as the total jail population changes over the past couple decades and what the jail population looks like when broken down by race.


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
